## Overview

This C implementation of binary trees includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. It provides a foundation for building more advanced tree-based algorithms.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Structure:** A simple structure representing a binary tree node.
- **Insertion:** Function to insert a new node into the binary tree.
- **Deletion:** Function to delete a node from the binary tree.
- **Traversal:** In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal functions.
- **Search:** Function to search for a specific value in the binary tree.

## Usage

To use the binary tree implementation in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tyrese-Mv/binary-trees-c.git
